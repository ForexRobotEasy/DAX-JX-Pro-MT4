## Input Parameters

- LotSize: The lot size for the buy orders.
- StopLoss: The stop loss level in pips.
- TakeProfit: The take profit level in pips.

## Global Variables

- tradeAllowed: A boolean variable to control whether trading is allowed.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the EA. It checks if the EA is attached to the correct symbol chart (DAX) and enables trading only if it is. Otherwise, it sets `tradeAllowed` to `false` and prints a message.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is removed from the chart. It performs any necessary cleanup tasks and sets `tradeAllowed` to `false`.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function that is executed on each tick of the market. It first checks if trading is allowed. If not, it simply returns. 

Next, it calculates the volatility using the Donchian Channel indicator. The upper and lower values of the channel are obtained using the `iHighest()` and `iLowest()` functions, respectively. The volatility is then calculated as the difference between the upper and lower values.

The current price is obtained using the `SymbolInfoDouble()` function.

Based on the volatility, the EA determines whether to place a buy order or not. If the volatility is greater than 0, it calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the current price and the input parameters. It then places a buy order using the `OrderSend()` function.

If the buy order is placed successfully, it prints a message with the ticket number. Otherwise, it prints a message with the error code obtained from `GetLastError()`.

If the volatility is less than or equal to 0, it prints a message indicating that there is no trading opportunity due to low volatility.

## Custom Functions

There are no additional custom functions or indicators in this code.
